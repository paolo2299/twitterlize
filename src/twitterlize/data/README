world-countries.json was obtained from http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/world-countries.json

Three of the country ids were missing (Somaliland, Western Sahara and Northern Cyprus). These were all listed as '-99'.
In this version of the file, I've filled in the missing ids as following:
Western Sahara - ESH
Somaliland - SOL (made up)
Northern Cyprus - CYN (made up)
